# Breath In, Draw Out

This installation is a way in which corporal expression is combined with creative expression, exploring the capacity and limits of the program. It is a space for reflection on computer art and “human” art, and where the line between the two intersects.

The projection consists of a “brush” created with lines through the user's movement, the view of the camera, discreetly in the background, and two indicators of the drawing's classification. The user's movement is captured by the camera using nose position tracking. The fact that the user can see their silhouette behind the drawing makes them part of it and aware of the movement of their body, which gives the project expressiveness and intimacy. When no one is present, the machine tries to imitate human behavior by drawing (autonomous drawing) even if the body is no longer present.

The program classifies the drawing, whether it is made by a human or a computer, trying to understand what is being drawn and giving a value for the confidence with which it makes this classification. This humanization is completed when the computer says what it thinks the drawing is, using various voices and accents in an attempt, often unsuccessful, to reach human capabilities.

The sound is also an exploration of this humanization of the machine, originally recordings of lung auscultations that were later distorted and synthesized to become the breathing of the machine itself. The design has an impact on the playback speed, which affects the pitch and gives the installation a sense of change of pace and emotion. This installation allows up to two users at the same time, which we consider an essential factor because the dynamic changes from a bodily expression to a collective composition in which total control is lost.

We want this project to show that the machine often can't replicate human behavior, nor the human the behavior of the machine, but that the symbiosis of the two makes it possible to create art.
